Socials is a social networking application that allows people to coordinate social events with large groups. The app allows users to create events which are then added to a feed. The user can tap on a specific event in the feed to learn more. The app also allows users to mark themselves as interested and allows users to see who else is interested in that event. The main dev core concepts used in the production of this app is Firebase authentication, database, storage, recycler views, Utils/Model classes, and Async Tasks.
